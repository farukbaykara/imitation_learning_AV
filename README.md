# Imitation Driving Learning Autonomous Vehicle Project Repo
Ä°mitation Learning Autonomous Driving Project repo

In this project, Lane following established with imitation learning (behavioral cloning). 
Obstacle detection made with KNN clustering algorithm on 2D Lidar point cloud. 
Object detection made with YOLOv4 algorithm. 
Pure Pursuit is used as control method. 

All packages created using ROS1 middleware and implemented in SVL simulator.
